A bad penny always turns up.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.
A change is as good as a rest.
A fool and his money are soon parted.
A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees. William Blake
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
A good beginning makes a good ending.
A good man is hard to find.
A hard beginning maketh a good ending. John Heywood
A house divided itself cannot stand.
A house is not a home.
A hungry man is an angry man.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
A leopard cannot change its spots.
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
A little of what you fancy does you good.
